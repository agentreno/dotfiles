# Karl's Dotfiles

## Quickstart

Health warning: don't just run other people's scripts without inspecting them 
for 'added value'. Use my dotfiles at your own risk.

`bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://github.com/agentreno/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh)"`

## TODO
1. Fix problem if .zshrc already exists
2. Pick out the best from Nitrous vim settings and incorporate
3. Install httpie by default
4. Install ngrok with github auth by default
